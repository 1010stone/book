## Open Online Training Curriculum 

We recently received funding from the NIH BD2K initiative to develop MOOCs for biomedical data science. Our first offering is the eight course series: Data Analysis for Genomics. The series provides different entry points for students with different levels of expertise. We provide four courses on concepts and skills and four case-study based course. 

1. [Statistics and R for the Life Sciences](https://www.edx.org/course/statistics-with-r-for-life-sciences-harvardx-ph525-1x)
2. [Introduction to Linear Models and Matrix Algebra](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-linear-models-and-matrix-algebra-harvardx-ph525-2x)
3. [Advanced Statistics for the Life Sciences](https://www.edx.org/course/advanced-statistics-for-the-life-sciences-harvardx-ph525-3x)
4. [Introduction to Bioconductor](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-bioconductor-harvardx-ph525-4x)
5. [Case study: RNA-seq data analysis](https://www.edx.org/course/case-study-rna-seq-data-analysis-harvardx-ph525-5x)
6. [Case study: Variant Discovery and Genotyping](https://www.edx.org/course/case-study-variant-discovery-and-genotyping-harvardx-ph525-6x)
7. [Case study: ChIP-seq data analysis](https://www.edx.org/course/case-study-chip-seq-data-analysis-harvardx-ph525-7x)
8. [Case study: DNA methylation data analysis](https://www.edx.org/course/case-study-dna-methylation-data-analysis-harvardx-ph525-8x)

You can follow the links to enroll. While not required for the first class, some familiarity with R and Rstudio will serve you well so consider the online courses listed on the [resources page](pages/resources.html).

In years 2 and 3 we plan to introduce several other courses covering topics such as python for data analysis, probability, software engineering, and data visualization.

Announcements will be made here and on twitter: [@rafalab](https://twitter.com/rafalab)

These classes were supported in part by NIH grant R25GM114818.
