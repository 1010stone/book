## Open Online Training Curriculum 

We recently received funding from the NIH BD2K initiative to develop
MOOCs for biomedical data science. We are now on the second version 
of our first offering, which is the seven course series: Data Analysis
for the Life Sciences. The first four courses are general data
analysis course and the last three specialize in genomics. The series
provides different entry points for students with different levels of
expertise.

1. [Statistics and R for the Life Sciences](https://www.edx.org/course/data-analysis-life-sciences-1-statistics-harvardx-ph525-1x)
2. [Introduction to Linear Models and Matrix Algebra](https://www.edx.org/course/data-analysis-life-sciences-2-harvardx-ph525-2x)
3. [Statistical Inference and Modeling for High-throughput Experiments](https://www.edx.org/course/data-analysis-life-sciences-3-harvardx-ph525-3x)
4. [High-Dimensional Data Analysis](https://www.edx.org/course/data-analysis-life-sciences-4-harvardx-ph525-4x)
5. [Bioconductor: Annotation and Analysis of Genomes and Genomic Assays](https://www.edx.org/course/data-analysis-life-sciences-5-harvardx-ph525-5x)
6. [High-performance Computing for Reproducible Genomics](https://www.edx.org/course/data-analysis-life-sciences-6-high-harvardx-ph525-6x)
7. [Case Studies in Functional Genomics](https://www.edx.org/course/data-analysis-life-sciences-7-case-harvardx-ph525-7xa)

Featuring the stellar instructors [course #]:

* [5,6] Vincent Carey of Harvard Medical School and Brigham And Women's Hospital
* [7] X. Shirley Liu and her lab at the Dana Farber Cancer-Institute and Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health

You can follow the links to enroll. While not required for the first class, some familiarity with R and Rstudio will serve you well so consider the online courses listed on the [resources page](resources.html).


Most of the teaching material is available as an [open online book](http://genomicsclass.github.io/book/) as well as on our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/genomicsclass/labs)

For the first four courses we will be using this freely available
[book](https://leanpub.com/dataanalysisforthelifesciences) which
includes links to the online material.

We are currently developing a course on Data Analysis with Python
which should be available this academic year.

Announcements will be made here and on twitter: [@rafalab](https://twitter.com/rafalab)

These classes were supported in part by NIH grant R25GM114818.
