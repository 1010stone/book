# HarvardX Biomedical Data Science

## Open Online Training Curriculum 

We recently received funding from the NIH BD2K initiative to develop MOOCs for biomedical data science. Our first offering will be version 2 of my Data Analysis for Genomics course which will launch on January 19. In this version, the course will be turned into an 8 course series and you can get a certificate in each one of them. The motivation for doing this is to go more in-depth into the different topics and to provide different entry points for students with different levels of expertise. We provide four courses on concepts and skills and four case-study based course. We basically broke the original class into the following eight parts:

- 1. [Statistics and R for the Life Sciences](https://www.edx.org/course/statistics-with-r-for-life-sciences-harvardx-ph525-1x)
- 2. [Introduction to Linear Models and Matrix Algebra](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-linear-models-and-matrix-algebra-harvardx-ph525-2x)
- 3. [Advanced Statistics for the Life Sciences](https://www.edx.org/course/advanced-statistics-for-the-life-sciences-harvardx-ph525-3x)
- 4. [Introduction to Bioconductor](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-bioconductor-harvardx-ph525-4x)
- 5. [Case study: RNA-seq data analysis](https://www.edx.org/course/case-study-rna-seq-data-analysis-harvardx-ph525-5x)
- 6. [Case study: Variant Discovery and Genotyping](https://www.edx.org/course/case-study-variant-discovery-and-genotyping-harvardx-ph525-6x)
- 7. [Case study: ChIP-seq data analysis](https://www.edx.org/course/case-study-chip-seq-data-analysis-harvardx-ph525-7x)
- 8. [Case study: DNA methylation data analysis](https://www.edx.org/course/case-study-dna-methylation-data-analysis-harvardx-ph525-8x)

You can follow the links to enroll. While not required, some familiarity with R and Rstudio will serve you well so consider taking Roger's R course and Jeff's Toolbox course before delving into this class.

In years 2 and 3 we plan to introduce several other courses covering topics such as python for data analysis, probability, software engineering, and data visualization which will be taught by a collaboration between the departments of Biostatistics, Statistics and Computer Science at Harvard.
