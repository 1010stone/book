## Open Online Training Curriculum 

In 2014 we received funding from the NIH BD2K initiative to develop
MOOCs for biomedical data science. The courses are divided into two series: Data Analysis for the Life Sciences and Genomics Data Analysis. 

Most of the teaching material is available as an [open online book](http://genomicsclass.github.io/book/) as well as on our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/genomicsclass/labs)

#### Data Analysis for the Life Sciences XSeries

You can enroll in this [here](https://www.edx.org/xseries/data-analysis-life-sciences). 

The series is composed of four courses. You can follow the links to enroll:

1. [Statistics and R for the Life Sciences](https://www.edx.org/course/data-analysis-life-sciences-1-statistics-harvardx-ph525-1x)
2. [Introduction to Linear Models and Matrix Algebra](https://www.edx.org/course/data-analysis-life-sciences-2-harvardx-ph525-2x)
3. [Statistical Inference and Modeling for High-throughput Experiments](https://www.edx.org/course/data-analysis-life-sciences-3-harvardx-ph525-3x)
4. [High-Dimensional Data Analysis](https://www.edx.org/course/data-analysis-life-sciences-4-harvardx-ph525-4x)

While not required for the first class, some familiarity with R and Rstudio will serve you well so consider the online courses listed on the [resources page](resources.html).

Four courses we will be using this freely available
[book](https://leanpub.com/dataanalysisforthelifesciences) which
includes links to the online material.

#### Genomics Data Analysis XSeries

You can enroll in this series [here](https://www.edx.org/xseries/genomics-data-analysis). 

This series focuses on Bioconductor and how it is used to analyze high-throughput data with a focus on next generation sequencing. The series is composed of three courses. You can follow the links to enroll:

1. [Introduction to Bioconductor: Annotation and Analysis of Genomes and Genomic Assays](https://www.edx.org/course/data-analysis-life-sciences-5-harvardx-ph525-5x)
2. [High-performance Computing for Reproducible Genomics](https://www.edx.org/course/data-analysis-life-sciences-6-high-harvardx-ph525-6x)
3. [Case Studies in Functional Genomics](https://www.edx.org/course/data-analysis-life-sciences-7-case-harvardx-ph525-7x)

Featuring the stellar instructors [course #]:

* [1,2] Vincent Carey of Harvard Medical School and Brigham And Women's Hospital
* [3] X. Shirley Liu and her lab at the Dana Farber Cancer-Institute and Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health


#### Future courses

We are currently developing a course on Data Analysis with Python
which should be available this academic year.

Announcements will be made here and on twitter: [@rafalab](https://twitter.com/rafalab)

These classes were supported in part by NIH grant R25GM114818.
